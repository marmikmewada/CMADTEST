            <p>
              CMAD uses a variety of surveillance methods. At the start of each
              mosquito season, generally sometime in May, our field workers
              start dipping. They visit standing bodies of water and use a white
              cup on the end of a pole to dip out some water. Mosquito larva,
              although very tiny, will show up as dark specks or rods against
              the white cup. If larva are found, then the larvicide is applied.
            </p>
            <p>
              Field workers use a white cup on the end of a pole to dip water to
              check for the presence of mosquito larvae.

              Also in May we decide where to place our mosquito traps. Using a
              CO2 tank to attract the female mosquitoes, we trap them overnight
              once a week. The traps are collected the following morning and
              taken back to the lab where the mosquitoes are counted and then,
              by using a dissecting microscope and strong magnifying glasses,
              they are also divided into species. In our District, the Culex
              species of mosquito typically carries West Nile Virus and Western
              Equine Encephalitis.

            <h1>Larvicide</h1>
            <p>
              Larvicide is our primary method to control mosquitoes; 80 percent
              of our abatement hours are spent checking standing water pools for
              mosquito larva and treating the water when we find the larva. We
              use different types of larvicide, depending on other organisms
              present in the water and on the size or surface area of the water.
              If the body of water is small enough and if fish or other aquatic
              residents are present, we use a product made from bacteria that
              targets only mosquito larva. In other cases, such as a large body
              of still water left after flooding, we'll use a pesticide mixed
              with a small amount of oil. This forms a very thin film on the
              surface of water that prevents the larva from getting oxygen to
              breathe, thus suffocating them, as well as poisoning the larva.
              This season, we will also use a spinosad compound to stop growth
              of the larva and prevent them from hatching into adults.

              Is fogging safe? Christopher Portier, director of the
              environmental toxicology program at the National Institute of
              Environmental Health Sciences in North Carolina, said,
              "...chemicals such as malathion, resmethrin and sumithrin have
              been used for years without noticeable toxic effects. They don't
              build up in the environment or the body like DDT. To get short
              term health problems, such as tremors, 'you'd have to literally
              drink the stuff."
            </p>
            <p>
              Each year, our field workers receive training on the application
              of pesticides and are certified by the Utah Department of
              Agriculture and Food as applicators. The fogging machines are
              tested and calibrated each year to ensure they are delivering the
              target amount of pesticide at a specific vehicle speed (anywhere
              from 12 mph up to 23 mph). Please note that some of our fogging
              machines are designed to turn off the flow of pesticide solution
              yet still allow the motor on the fogging pump to continue running.
              This feature allows for better control of the application
              (avoiding bee hives, organic farms, etc.).
            </p>
            <p>
              We have also added GPS tracking to our arsenal of tools to
              identify routes taken, environmental conditions, pesticide
              applied, and what time of night (for fogging) or day (for
              larviciding). The data collected will help us in identifying
              hotspots, track total amount of pesticide applied each season, and
              correlate applications with environmental conditions (wind speed
              and direction, air temperature, etc.).
            </p>
            <p>
              Our goal is not eradication of mosquitoes but to control them to
              reduce their nuisance factor and the spread of disease. Fogging is
              done in the evening between dusk and midnight. This is when
              mosquitoes such as the Culex species are most active and therefore
              most likely to be killed by the pesticide. Bees and native
              pollinators return to their hives at dusk and so are not likely to
              be exposed to the pesticide. Kontrol breaks down quickly in our
              environment (less than a day).
